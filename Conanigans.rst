Conan-igans for IncludeOS
==========================

We have recently changed the way we build IncludeOS. We are now using the C/C++
package manager - Conan to build IncludeOS. We have developed conan packages for
IncludeOS and all it's dependency libraries which we have currently made available
on `Bintray <https://bintray.com/includeos/includeos>`__ .
